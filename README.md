# ProVerif Implementation of "A Lightweight and Secure Extended AKA Protocol for Direct-to-Cell LEO Satellite Constellations"

This repository contains the **ProVerif** formal verification code for the extend authentication and key agreement (eAKA) protocol proposed in the paper:

> **"A Lightweight and Secure Extended Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Direct-to-Cell LEO Satellite Constellations"**

The protocol is designed for secure and efficient mobile users authentication and session key establishment in direct-to-cell low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems. This ProVerif implementation verifies the security properties of the protocol under the **Dolev-Yao threat model**.

## üîç Verified Security Properties

The following security properties have been formally verified using ProVerif:

- ‚úÖ **Secrecy of the group key and session key**  
  Ensures that the negotiated keys remain confidential against active attackers.

- ‚úÖ **Authenticity of bootstrapping messages**  
  Confirms that system parameters (e.g., MIB/SIBs) are signed and authenticated by the legitimate satellite.

- ‚úÖ **Mutual authentication between satellite and mobile users (MUs)**  
  Guarantees that both the satellite and users can authenticate each other during the AKA process.

  - Protocol roles (Satellite, Mobile User, CN )
  - Message flows
  - Security queries (secrecy, authentication)
